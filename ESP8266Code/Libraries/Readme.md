Arduino libraries take a complex task and boil it down to simple to use functions.

Installing a Library - Windows

This section covers installing a library under the Windows environment. Find the zip file on your local computer (wherever downloaded files end up). Under Windows, you should be able to double click on the file to open it up.
Libraries will usually contain a .cpp file and .h file. Most will also contain an examples folder.
Under Windows, Arduino stores all the add-on libraries within the My Documents folder.
Open an explorer window and navigate to the libraries folder under My Documents. Now copy the new CapacitiveSensor folder to the libraries folder. (See the image added along with this Read.md)

Note: Arduino does not allow library folders to contain symbols such as hyphens ‘-’. Arduino will throw an error upon starting up. If the library you are installing has a funky folder name then this step is the ideal time to clean it up.

To verify the library has been installed correctly, open up the Examples folder under the Arduino IDE.
