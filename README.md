# SmartMaliProject
A Smart Pot for Indoor Gardening!!

Mali (माली) is a Hindi word, commonly used for the person who makes and maintains garden.

Have you tried kitchen gardening but given up after initial confusion and failures? Are you too busy to take care of your plants? Want to go on vacation but fear the worst for your indoor garden? Having green spaces in our homes the key to maintaining a happy and healthy lifestyle. Plants and flowers demand attention and delicate conditions to be healthy and look beautiful.

Growing plants is a very pleasant experience. But our pace of life gives us little chance to keep the exact rhythm of watering the plants according to their needs. With how busy our lives are, it's sometimes easy to forget to pay a little attention to your thirsty indoor plants until it's too late and you are left with a crusty pile of yellow carcasses. The main reasons for dying plants are over- and under-watering, temperature and light issues. That’s probably happening because plants can’t talk and express directly what they need. They may need very careful and accurate watering. Some of them need more light and some need less. Air temperature and humidity are also highly important.

SmartMali is a smart plant pot that has sensors to detect sunlight, soil moisture, air temperature and humidity. These are the most critical 'vitals' that indicate a plant's well being - does it have enough sunlight, water? They will send you these values on your mobile app and based on that you can take appropriate actions. Using this specialized sensors, it automatically waters and monitors your plants in real time. It is connected to the internet with SparkFun ESP8266 Thing Dev Board.

You never have to worry about dead plants again. This automated smart pot will take care of watering your plants and provide artificial sunlight. It pot has a motor and a reservoir, which you can fill with water once in a while.

Goals for the project:-
 * Automatically water your plants 
 * Monitor plant vitals in real time 
 * Switch ON the grow light when needed 
 * Upto atleast a month of watering
